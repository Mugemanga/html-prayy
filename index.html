        <p> Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 
             Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.  
             For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,  
             against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 
              Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, 
             and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, 
                 and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of  
                 the gospel of peace; 16Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 
             And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:(Ephesians 6:10-17)

    <p class="paragraph1">One common challenge in prayer is maintaining consistency (1 Thessalonians 5:17).  
            One of the biggest problems that people encounter is they start with hype and then burn out,  
            fizzle out, or lose the passion that they started off with. In order for that to not happen to you,  
            it’s important to realize that it’s the habits that will get you through, not the hype.  
            Instead of striving for long prayers daily, focus on regular prayer. 
             Make it your aim to have a consistent prayer life that refreshes and blesses you

            <div class="bible2"> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.

                2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
                
                3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
                
                4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
                
                5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
                
                6 For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.(Psalm 1)</div> 
            <div class="bible3">Love never gives up. Love cares more for others than for self. Love doesn't want what  
                it doesn't have. Love doesn't strut, Doesn't have a swelled head,  Doesn't force itself on others, Isn't always "me first, 
                " Doesn't fly off the handle, Doesn't keep score of the sins of others,  Doesn't revel when others grovel, Takes pleasure in the  
                flowering of truth,  Puts up with anything, Trusts God always, Always looks for the best,  
                Never looks back, But keeps going to the end.</div>
